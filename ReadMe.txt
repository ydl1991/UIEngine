UI Engine

A UI Engine with a demo game that is composed by UI only.

The UI manager is the one that processes all the UI elements, there are different types of UI elements eg. stack, wrap, image, textfield, button, input, scroll, repeat etc. Also implemented data binding stuff to make UI data saving more flexible.
