        With this test, it is very similar to Test-Data-2 except that we are providing
        a default value through a <Data> element.  This means that the <Input> element
        should be pre-populated with the initial value for 'label'.
        Additionally, the data-bound variable label is not the only text present in the
        Label's text attribute.  So, for example, the Label should initially display
        the text "Text: Data-driven text!" and only the portion represented by {label}
        should change.
    -->
    <Data variable="label" value="Data-driven text!" />
    <Stack>
        <Input text="{label}" />
        <Label text="Text: {label}" />
    </Stack>
</UI>
